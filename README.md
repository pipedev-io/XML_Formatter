## XML Formatter
Just a simple XML formatter because I got tired of sketchy online tools.

### What it does?
Takes your messy XML
Makes it pretty
That's it

### Tech stuff
This is V0 - nothing fancy. Used an existing XML library for the heavy lifting, just wanted to get a basic frontend talking to a backend.

How to run it:
go to pipedev.io

### Files
app.py - Flask backend
index.html - The page
index.js - Makes buttons work
styles/index.css - Makes it not ugly

### Why
Needed this for work. Online formatters are hit or miss. Figured I'd make my own.

### What's next (V1)
Planning to ditch the library and build my own:

Custom formatting algorithm from scratch

Because why use someone else's when you can over-engineer your own?
That's about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
